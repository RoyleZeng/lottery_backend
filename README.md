# Lottery Backend API

A FastAPI backend for managing lottery events, participants, prizes, drawing winners, exporting winner lists, and sending email notifications.

## Setup

1. Make sure you have PostgreSQL installed and running
2. Create a database and user as per the configuration in `lottery_api/data_access_object/db.py`
3. Run the database migration script: `psql -U <username> -d <database> -f db_migrations/lottery_tables.sql`
4. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt` or `poetry install`
5. Start the server: `uvicorn lottery_api.main:app --reload`

## API Documentation

Once the server is running, you can access the API documentation at: `http://localhost:8000/spec/doc`

## Data Format for Participants Upload

The system supports uploading participants via Excel or CSV files. The file should contain columns that match the fields in the `lottery_participants` table. Common fields include:

- department - Department/Faculty name
- student_id - Student ID number
- name - Student name
- grade - Student grade/year
- required_surveys - Number of surveys required

- valid_surveys - Whether the surveys are valid (boolean)
- id_number - ID card number
- address - Home address
- identity_type - Type of identity
- phone - Contact phone number
- email - Email address

The actual fields used will depend on what data you include in your upload file.

## Email Configuration

The system supports sending emails through external SMTP servers with optimized support for NCHU (National Chung Hsing University) mail servers.

### NCHU (National Chung Hsing University) Configuration

**Recommended (Secure Connection)**:

```json
{
  "smtp_server": "dragon.nchu.edu.tw",
  "smtp_port": 465,
  "username": "your-username@dragon.nchu.edu.tw",
  "password": "your-password",
  "use_tls": true
}
```

**Alternative (Plain Connection - Not Recommended)**:

```json
{
  "smtp_server": "dragon.nchu.edu.tw",
  "smtp_port": 25,
  "username": "your-username@dragon.nchu.edu.tw",
